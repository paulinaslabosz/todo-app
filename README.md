### Project

Classic To-Do App. You can add tasks and specify whether they are a priority. You can check all tasks or only the most important ones. And if you do the task, you can see the date and time they were taken.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
